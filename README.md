# Flyer Social
Flyer social is a social media app that is intended to make important information for Texas Tech students to be more easilty available.
Staff, students, and organizations can come together to post flyers to give information to groups they believe should see them.
Staff members can post about upcoming events in order for students to easily be informed about them and instantly add them to their calendars.

## Firebase Database

In order to simplify taking the data from a database we created different classes for each object in our UI. Above is an example for flyer bubbles.
One of the most important parts of our project is reading data from our firebase database.

Above is how we were able to process the information in our database, in the class that we need to access this information we call the published set in the class.
The inspiration for this came from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz9XQy8PRpQ&t=954s.

## Firebase Auth

Another major feature for our application is firebase authentication which will allow the user to login with the information they signed up with.
Once the user clicks the login button the function above is executed and checks if the information is correct.
Upon successful login the user will be directed to a authentication page or the main page.
